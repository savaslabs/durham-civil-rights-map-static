  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Sitting-In for Justice – S. H. Kress Lunch Counter 1961&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden"&gt;&lt;span lang="" about="http://savaslabs.github.io/user/233" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name" datatype="" xml:lang=""&gt;balau&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden"&gt;Wed, 05/04/2016 - 15:22&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lunch counter sit ins by young people in Durham were inspired by the moving speech given by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at Durham's White Rock Baptist Church in 1961. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1963, a dark and lonely jail cell in Birmingham, Alabama served as the setting of the conception of one of the most important civil rights documents of the past 100 years. Martin Luther King Jr., following the peak of the non-violent Birmingham Campaign’s unfortunate decent into conflict, penned his “Letter from Birmingham Jail” on scraps of paper slipped under his door by a janitor and a legal pad his counsel allowed him to keep. On these scraps, the reverend urged his fellow activists to engage in “direct action, whereby they would present their very bodies as a means of laying their cause before the conscience of the local and national community.” The Civil Rights Movement had escalated to the point that imprisonment for the outspoken activists in the South became more than possible: it was almost a certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years earlier, Martin Luther King Jr. had known that his would be the case. That year, he urged over 1,200 people at White Rock Baptist Church in Durham, NC to stay strong, and “not fear going to jail… if the willingness to stay in jail (will) arouse the dozing conscience of our nation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These words sparked the imagination of a woman named Fay Bryant Mayo. Mayo was a Durham resident, who, along with countless others, was inspired to launch her own fearless campaign to demonstrate that the unjust laws that were in place were meant to be opposed. Each day, a group of Durham activists including Robert Lawson, Phyllis Shumate and Quentin Baker would gather near the art deco exterior of the towering Kress Building in downtown and enter one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each person would stroll through the front door of the department store, buy one sandwich from the lunch counter, and immediately cross into the all-white dining section. As Lawson said, “as soon as you would sit down and bite into that sandwich, the police would come.” These students returned two or three times each and every day to the same sandwich counter in Kress to buy their lunch and sit where they believed they had the right to sit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, surely, was the direct action that King would later call for from a cell in Alabama, and these young activists, surely, were ahead of their time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Lunch Counter Sit In at Woolworth Five &amp; Dime</title>

  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Lunch Counter Sit In at Woolworth Five &amp; Dime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden"&gt;&lt;span lang="" about="http://savaslabs.github.io/user/233" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name" datatype="" xml:lang=""&gt;balau&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden"&gt;Tue, 04/19/2016 - 16:35&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How powerful is silence? Can you really promote a cause by not saying anything at all directed toward authorities? North Carolina College students did just that. They vowed to fight against segregated serving policies through silent and peaceful protest. They would stand up, or, rather, sit down, for their rights. Following the February 1st sit-in protests in Greensboro, Durham students took charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, February 8, 1960, seventeen black North Carolina College students staged sit-ins at three white lunch counters in Durham. Several white Duke University students joined them and pledged to occupy seats until the blacks were served. First they went to Woolworth’s. They sat in vacant seats and asked for service. The waiters refused. But the protesters did not fight back. They remained seated and started talking quietly amongst themselves, studying textbooks, and reading newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At noon, the store received a fake bomb threat and immediately closed for the rest of the day. Then they left for the Kress store, but did not even make it into the doors before the management closed the store. Next, they marched over to Walgreen’s, but whites had completely monopolized the counters. They had no choice but to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the protest, no black students were arrested, but two white students from Duke were taken to the station for questioning. The protesters were not dissuaded. They planned to continue the sit-downs the following day. On Tuesday morning, they marched to the stores to reclaim their rights. They were met by signs reading “Closed temporarily in the interest of public safety.” All three stores had been closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest was brought to a standstill, but did not deem their attempts “failed.” These attempts encouraged nonviolent attempts at justice throughout the nation. For months following, black students all over the Deep South mimicked the Durham sit-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Durham students showed how powerful protest can be without the interference of hateful words or violent actions. The Durham sit-ins were the beginning of a 4 year nationwide effort that resulted in the desegregation of all lunch counters in 1964.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Standing Together – Resisting Lunch Counter Segregation at Evans United Department Store</title>

  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Standing Together – Resisting Lunch Counter Segregation at Evans United Department Store&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden"&gt;&lt;span lang="" about="http://savaslabs.github.io/user/233" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name" datatype="" xml:lang=""&gt;balau&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden"&gt;Tue, 04/19/2016 - 15:34&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Did the roof fall in today?” Mayor Mutt Evans asked the manager at Woolworth’s five and dime in the downtown Durham in July 1960. The business had just served a Coke to its first black customer. It was the start of a new era for the Bull City  and as Durham’s first Jewish mayor, Mutt Evans was uniquely equipped to navigate the period’s racial tension and lead Durham towards a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Evans faced intense anti-Semitic resistance during his campaign in 1950, his slogan “Equal Representation for all People” resonated with Durham’s African American community. Their support enabled him to win the election and serve Durham from1951 through 1963, the most volatile years of the civil rights struggle. Evans’ leadership was not confined, however, to his terms as mayor. He also advocated for racial justice as an ordinary citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans and his family owned Evans United Department Store on West Main Street. The store boasted the only integrated lunch counter in downtown Durham during the 1950’s. When authorities demanded that Mr. Evans build a wall between black and white customers at the lunch counter, his refusal to compromise his company’s pro-integration stance led to an ingenious solution. By removing its seating and raising the counter to an elbow leaning height, the lunch counter at Evans United Department Store remained integrated through a technicality that allowed blacks and whites to stand, but not sit, together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans United Department Store is one example of the complex relationship between Durham’s Jewish and African American communities. The proximity of Pine Street, a middle-class Jewish enclave, to Hayti, Durham’s African American neighborhood tied together the fates of the Jewish and African American communities. By catering to Durham’s underserved black community, Jewish businesses flourished and forged economic ties between the two groups. However, this economic partnership did not always lead to social harmony. For example, during Durham’s civil rights struggle, their justifiable fear of the Ku Klux Klan caused many of Durham’s Jews to remain silent or even resist integration. However, Mutt Evans resisted this pressure both through his individual activism and work in the public sphere. His bravery proved that collaboration has the power to bring honor and justice to all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
